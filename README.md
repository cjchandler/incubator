## incubator

in the code section run main_loopV2_inubator.py That should connect to phidgets and run the incubator controls. It wil send sms alams if there is a poblem. 
 It also should update the last_update_repo file every few min and push to git hub. Then the server can keep an eye on that and send an sms if there are no updates for 7 min
